# linear-regression-uncertainties
This program created with R and Shiny can produce good-looking graphs of linear regressions of data points with uncertainties. The **Web_Linreg** folder contains the ui.R and server.R files for a fully interactive Shiny application, and the **LinearRegression.R** file is a basic implementation of the method for those who have some experience with R. 

The creation of this program was inspired by [LinReg](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/old/source/AboutLinReg.html) by Thomas A. Moore. The description that the author provides about how his program works was used to produce the R code that is the basis of this project, and this R program was designed to be a version of Thomas A. Moore's LinReg program in R with more features that would be easier to modify.
